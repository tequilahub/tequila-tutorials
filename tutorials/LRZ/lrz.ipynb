    "The Munich Quantum Valley provides a Qiskit-backend, which can be used as a sampling backend for Tequila. If this backend is installed and configured with a valid API-Key, it is possible to run Tequila Quantum Circuits on the LRZ Quantum Computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. install the mqp qiskit provider `pip install mqp-qiskit-provider`\n",
    "2. successful installation can be checked with \n",

    "## Use Case Example: HCB Groupings\n",
    "\n",
    "The following demonstrates how to use Tequilas MQP Backend to compute the ground state energy of a Hardcore Boson Hamiltonian (HCB).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background: VQE \n",
    "\n",
    "The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a technique for finding the smallest eigenvalue of the electronic Hamiltonian, which describes the groundstate energy of a molecule [@vqe]. The algorithm uses the variational principle\n",
    "\n",
    "$$argmin_{\\theta} \\langle U(\\theta)|H|U(\\theta)\\rangle$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta$ somehow parametrizes the quantum circuit $U(\\theta)$ and $H$ is the Hamiltonian. The expectation value of $H$ is an upper bound for the smallest eigenvalue $E_0$. To see why this works: because $H$ is Hermitian, any state $|\\psi\\rangle$ can be written as a linear combination of orthogonal eigenstates of the Hamiltonian:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_k c_k|E_k\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\langle\\psi|H|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_k |c_k|^2\\langle E_k|H|E_k\\rangle  = \\sum_k |c_k|^2 E_k \\geq E_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By finding the $\\theta$ that minimizes $\\langle U(\\theta)|H|U(\\theta)\\rangle$ we can find an approximation for $E_0$. However, we still need to find a suitable ansatz for $U(\\theta)$ and suitable approximation for $H$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The HCB Hamiltonian \n",
    "\n",
    "The electronic hamiltonian of a molecule in second quantization is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H = \\sum_{kl} h_{kl} a^\\dagger_k a_l + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{klmn} g_{klmn}a_k^\\dagger a_l^\\dagger a_n a_m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a_k^\\dagger$ and $a_k$ are the creation and annihilation operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate the expectation value of this hamiltonian on a quantum computer, it has to be expressed as a sum of Paulistrings. Typically the Jordan-Wigner encoding is used to achieve this. But there is a problem: in Jordan-Wigner the creation and annihilation operators are encoded as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$a_k = (\\otimes^{k-1}_{l=1} Z)\\otimes \\sigma^+$: annihilation operator\n",
    "\n",
    "$a_k^\\dagger = (\\otimes^{k-1}_{l=1} Z)\\otimes \\sigma^-$: creation operator\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\sigma^{±} = \\frac{1}{2}(X±iY)$\n",
    "\n",
    "to encode the antisymmetry of the wavefunction inside the creation and annihilation operators. However, this encoding is rather nonlocal (i.e. there are many qubits affected by a single action), as there is a $Z$ placed on every qubit before $k$ [@hybrid]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The HCB-Hamiltonian is an approximation that improves the locality and reduces the number of gates in the circuit by 'spin-pairing electrons into quasi-bosonic particles' [@hcb] and restricting the number of unpaired electrons to zero. In this model, electrons can only be created and annihilated in pairs (so only double excitations are possible and every spatial orbital is either filled with two or zero electrons). This makes these operations symmetric. \n",
    "It also has the additional benefit of cutting the number of necessary qubits in half because now there is one qubit per spatial orbital instead of one qubit per spin-orbital. \n",
    "\n",
    "But there is another advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, when sampling the Expectation Value of a Hamiltonian $H = \\sum_i c_iP_i$ that consists of multiple Pauli-Strings $P_i$ with Tequila, every Paulistring is diagonalized into a Pauli-$Z$-String with a basis changing unitary operation, and then the expectation values for each diagonalized Paulistring are measured individually. This is necessary because measurements on the QPU are done by reading out the qubits, which means that we are measuring in the $Z$-basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence the number of jobs that are submitted to the backend is equal to the number of Paulistrings in the Hamiltonian.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because we are not the only users of the LRZ QPU, it might take a long time until our jobs are actually scheduled, so we would like to reduce the number of jobs. We want to find circuits that diagonalize as many Paulistrings simultaneously as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, the HCB-Hamiltonian naturally decomposes into three commuting groups of Paulistrings: an $X$, a $Y$ and a $Z$ group, depending on whether the Pauli-String contains only $X$, $Y$ or $Z$ operators [@hcb]. With this grouping, we can reduce the number of jobs to three. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The SPA Ansatz\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to choose an ansatz for $U(\\theta)$ that is capable of expressing the groundstate adequately.  Separable Pair Approximation is one possible ansatz. It 'leverages valence-bond structure' [@hcb] – i.e. we derive the SPA circuit from the chemical graph of the molecule (where we have already made some assumptions about the bonds)."

    "After measuring the expectation values for each group on the LRZ QPU for different molecules, we noticed that the variance and error of the calculated groundstate energy were very high for the $Z$-group.\n",
    "\n",
    "@fig-z shows a histogram of counts for the $Z$-HCB group of the $H_4$ HCB-Hamiltonian. The different bitstring counts for the ground state calculation that was closest to the exact energy and the bitstring counts for the energy that were the most inaccurate are shown.\n",

    "\n",
    "The $Z$-Group was the most error-prone. Here, the bitstring that appears most often in the best result was sampled not even once in the worst result. For comparision, here are the histrograms for the $X$ and $Y$ groups: \n",

    "\n",
    "Luckily, the $Z$-Group is already in the $Z$-basis. This allows us to apply a symmetry-based error mitigation: As described above, in the HCB Hamiltonian, one qubit encodes one spatial orbital and if a $1$ is measured in a qubit, that means that there are $2$ electrons in the corresponding spatial orbital. So the number of 1s that can appear in a single bitstring must be equal to $\\frac{a}{2}$ where $a$ is the number of non-core electrons in the molecule, i.e. for $H_4$ we expect to measure two 1s. \n",
