    "The Munich Quantum Valley provides a Qiskit-backend, which can be used as a sampling backend for Tequila. If this backend is installed and configured with a valid API-Key, it is possible to run Tequila Quantum Circuits on the LRZ Quantum Computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. install the mqp qiskit provider `pip install mqp-qiskit-provider`\n",
    "2. successful installation can be checked with \n",

The [Qiskit AQT Provider](https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-aqt-provider/) offers a backend that represents a noiseless simulation of the AQT Hardware, which can be used for this purpose. \n",

    "#### HCB Groupings\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, when sampling the Expectation Value of a Hamiltonian $H = \\sum_i c_iP_i$ that consists of multiple Paulistrings $P_i$ with Tequila, every Pauli-String is diagonalized into a Pauli-Z-String with a basis changing unitary operation. This is necessary because measurements on the QPU are done by reading out the qubits, which means that we are measuring in the Z-basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the number of Jobs that is submitted to the backend is equal to the number of Pauli-Strings in the Hamiltonian.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because of the long wait times we don't want to sample every Paulistring individually. By arranging the Pauli-Strings in a Hardcore-Boson-Grouping, the number of jobs can be reduced to 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "A HCB-Grouping sorts every Pauli-String of a Hardcore Boson Hamiltonian (HCB) into an X, a Y or a Z group, depending on whether the Pauli-String contains only X, Y or Z operators (this only works for the HCB Hamiltonian where every Pauli-String can only contain one type of Pauli matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following performs the grouping for a HCB Hamiltonian and simultaneously computes the unitary operators that are needed to diagonalize each group. @hcb\n",
    "\n",
    "The three HCB-Groups are then sampled by appending their diagonalizing circuits to the original circuit, before sending it to the backend."
