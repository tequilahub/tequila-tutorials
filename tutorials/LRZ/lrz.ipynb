    "Usually, when sampling the Expectation Value of a Hamiltonian $H = \\sum_i c_iP_i$ that consists of multiple Pauli-Strings $P_i$ with Tequila, every Pauli-String is diagonalized into a Pauli-Z-String with a basis changing unitary operation. This is necessary because measurements on the QPU are done by reading out the qubits, which means that we are measuring in the Z-basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the number of Jobs that is submitted to the backend is equal to the number of Pauli-Strings in the Hamiltonian.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because of the long wait times we don't want to sample every Pauli-String individually. By arranging the Pauli-Strings in a Hardcore-Boson-Grouping, the number of jobs can be reduced to 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "A HCB-Grouping sorts every Pauli-String of a Hardcore Boson Hamiltonian (HCB) into an X, a Y or a Z group, depending on whether the Pauli-String contains only X, Y or Z operators (this only works for the HCB Hamiltonian where every Pauli-String can only contain one type of Pauli matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following performs the grouping for a HCB-Hamiltonian and simultaneously computes the unitary operators that are needed to diagonalize each group. (@hcb)\n",
    "\n",
    "The three HCB-Groups are then sampled by appending their diagonalizing circuits to the original circuit, before sending it to the backend."

The number of 1s that can appear in a single bitstring must be equal to $\\frac{a}{2}$ where $a$ is the number of orbitals or qubits, which for the HCB-Hamiltonian of a hydrogen chain is the number of hydrogen atoms. We derive this number from the fact that in the HCB-Hamiltonian we are \"spin-pairing the electrons into Bosonic quasi-particles\" (@hybrid) which means that measuring a 1 in a qubit actually represents $2$ electrons, so a bitstring with not exactly $\\frac{a}{2}$ 1s is physically impossible - the number of electrons in the system would not match up anymore. \n",
